# Card-Matching-Game

I used HTML, CSS, JavaScript to make this game. 
My card matching game project is a project assignment I did when I was at university. 
I took care to use JS DOM structure while making this game.

##Game Setup
After downloading the game file and making sure that it is not in the zip file, just double click on the "index.html" web page.

##Gameplay
The gameplay is very simple. 
You click on two of the cards and try to match the cards that keep coming up randomly. 
If you get it wrong, the cards spin again, if you get it right, the cards add 1 to your score. 
You can see your total score and in-game score in the table on the right. 
Have a good game.
